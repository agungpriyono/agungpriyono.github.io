Jekyll is a great tool to create static sites but with static site, there's no backend to send your data to: that is why it's hard to put a form on a Jekyll site.

Here listed some resources which provide  a saas service as a backend for forms (contact forms, hiring forms, etc.) to designers and developers like you:
1. [Formspree (also open source, free)](https://formspree.io/)
2. [FormKeep](https://formkeep.com/guides/contact-form-jekyll)
3. [Simple Form](https://getsimpleform.com/)

[Go to the Home Page]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }})
